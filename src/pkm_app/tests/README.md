# Tests Directory

## Purpose

This `tests` directory contains all automated tests for the Kairos BCP application. Its primary goal is to ensure the correctness, reliability, and robustness of the application's codebase by verifying its behavior at different levels of granularity.

The testing strategy aims to cover:
* Core domain logic in isolation.
* Application use cases and their orchestration of domain logic.
* Integration points between different layers, especially with the infrastructure (e.g., database).

## Key Subdirectories

* **`unit/`**: Contains unit tests. These tests focus on small, isolated pieces of code (e.g., individual functions or methods within entities, domain services, use cases, or utility functions in infrastructure).
    * `core/`: Unit tests for the `domain` and `application` sub-layers. Dependencies on repositories or external services are typically mocked.
    * `infrastructure/`: Unit tests for any isolatable logic within infrastructure components (though much of infrastructure is better tested with integration tests).
* **`integration/`**: Contains integration tests. These tests verify the interaction between different components or layers.
    * `infrastructure/`: Tests the integration of infrastructure adapters with actual external systems (e.g., testing SQLAlchemy repository implementations against a real test database).
* **`e2e/` (Optional/Future)**: May contain end-to-end tests that simulate full user scenarios, from UI interaction or API calls down to the database and back.

## Frameworks and Tools

* **Pytest** is the recommended framework for writing and running tests due to its conciseness and powerful features (fixtures, plugins).
* Mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`) will be used for isolating components in unit tests.

## Design Rationale

A comprehensive suite of automated tests is crucial for maintaining code quality, enabling safe refactoring, and catching regressions early in the development cycle. The structured organization of tests (unit, integration) reflects the application's architecture and allows for targeted testing of different aspects of Kairos BCP. This aligns with the Clean Architecture's emphasis on testability.
